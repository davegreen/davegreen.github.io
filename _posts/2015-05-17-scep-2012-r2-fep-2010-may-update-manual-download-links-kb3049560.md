Another month, another update for the Microsoft Endpoint Protection engine!

Unfortunately, I hoped the ADMX template for managing SCEP 2012 that was mentioned when the update was first released would be available, but it looks like it's been pulled for some reason. I'll keep an eye out for it though and hopefully it will mean I don't have to maintain my own ADMX template for this anymore.

As I've done previously, I pulled these download links from SCCM, viewing the Content Information in the update view for KB3049560.

[Here's the update](https://wsus.ds.download.windowsupdate.com/c/msdownload/update/software/crup/2015/05/updateinstall_a4deb3eebd3ac19f8b465097d818708a0e0d87c7.exe), it appears to be the same for both FEP 2010 and SCEP 2012.

These files are hosted by Microsoft and may disappear at any time!

Have fun!
