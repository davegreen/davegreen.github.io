I've been starting to put some bass down for a couple of my mates tracks, i'll update with some audio when I get the chance. It's an excellent blend of thrash and old-school metal with a modern twist.

I started to record my basslines with [Audacity](http://audacity.sf.net), but it was quite annoying having to split the signal at the output of the amp head for monitoring and not being able to properly monitor the recorded signal. I ended up moving to [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm), which gives me a lot more versatility for recording.

I also played a gig with [Tom Bertram](http://www.tombertram.co.uk) today, a charity gig at the [RMA Tavern](http://www.rmatavern.co.uk). We got a good reception and played a new song as a finale. It went down really really well!
