A few changes, some big (header images), some small (loads of small CSS positioning changes).

I expect changes will continue, as always, these things are works in progress for the most part as I see things that could be better.

Everything else has been pretty much left as it was, for the moment. I will be doing some recording this Sunday for the 'Metal project' and I'll be getting back into the Rails development with a vengeance, ill probably work on some ideas I've had for some build up projects to get me used to various aspects of rails development.
