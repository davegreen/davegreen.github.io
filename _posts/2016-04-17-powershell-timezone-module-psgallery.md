Today, I published my first module to the <a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Timezone/">PowerShell gallery!</a>

It's the fairly simple module I wrote to manage the timezone on the local machine, wrapping the tzutil command. It's all really come together over the last couple of days (I  fixed a bunch of problems by writing some proper tests for it!). I've also been using it to work with a lot of cool stuff with it like advanced parameter completion, psake and PSDeploy to streamline the testing and deployment.

Some of these ideas came from things I saw recently on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRd0XiMIRMs&amp;list=PLfeA8kIs7Coc1Jn5hC4e_XgbFUaS5jY2i&amp;index=8">PowerShell.org</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GgpwjsFQXc&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLfeA8kIs7Coc1Jn5hC4e_XgbFUaS5jY2i">Global</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPoE_TsyuX8&amp;index=10&amp;list=PLfeA8kIs7Coc1Jn5hC4e_XgbFUaS5jY2i">Summit</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyADIv3E-ec&amp;index=18&amp;list=PLfeA8kIs7Coc1Jn5hC4e_XgbFUaS5jY2i">videos</a> (They are all incredible). I'm annoyed I couldn't make it this time,  but the videos and the other awesome stuff people are doing with PowerShell getting out there is great!
