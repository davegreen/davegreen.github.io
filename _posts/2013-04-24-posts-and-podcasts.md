Here are two podcasts I have absolutely no reservations in recommending to anyone interested in how the world works or the magic of discovery. Their websites will do a better job of explaining it than I can, so here they are!

I've got some upcoming content on System Center 2012, focussing mostly on Service Manager, as there isn't too much content out there. It's almost like the black sheep of the System Center 2012 family, although that might change when/if either Sharepoint 2010 gets updated to support Server 2012, or Service Manager gets updated to support Sharepoint 2013.

There will also be some little bits on Operations Manager and maybe some things that apply to any System Center product, or SQL Server.
