I've been learning some Ruby on Rails recently, it's been pretty good fun. If you are looking to get started with some RoR, here's some of the recources i used:

- [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/)
- [Rails for Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/)
- [Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails By Example](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book)

I've also got two books on the way to use as a reference and help me along:

- [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Development-Rails-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356549/)
- [Eloquent Ruby](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321584104/)

It's going pretty well and I'm enjoying it. I've got some ideas that prompted me to learn this, as I wanted to use something other than my normal web development process, whichÂ  involved stacks of PHP. I do like PHP, but I do occasionally feel the need to learn some new stuff on occasion. I like the way Rails provides a nice framework for everything, this foray into new territory might improve my web design too!
