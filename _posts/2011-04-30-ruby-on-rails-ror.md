I've been learning some Ruby on Rails recently, it's been pretty good fun. If you are looking to get started with some RoR, here's some of the recources i used:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://tryruby.org/">Try Ruby</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails By Example</a></li>
</ul>
I've also got two books on the way to use as a reference and help me along:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Development-Rails-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356549/">Agile Web Development with Rails</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321584104/">Eloquent Ruby</a></li>
</ul>
It's going pretty well and I'm enjoying it. I've got some ideas that prompted me to learn this, as I wanted to use something other than my normal web development process, whichÂ  involved stacks of PHP. I do like PHP, but I do occasionally feel the need to learn some new stuff on occasion. I like the way Rails provides a nice framework for everything, this foray into new territory might improve my web design too!
