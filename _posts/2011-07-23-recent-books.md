Just thought I would share some of the books I have read recently:
<ul>
	<li>Triumff: Her Majesty's Hero - Dan Abnett
A brilliant romp through an alternate-universe England where 'The Arte', a form of magic takes the place of science and technology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Rule 34 - Charles Stross
If you are familiar with the definition of rule 34, or any of Stross' earlier work, this is for you. It's probably his best novel so far, with his 'Laundry Files' series a close second.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card
A book I re-read a lot, I came back to it again recently. This really is an exceptional novel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Space Wolf Omnibus - William King</li>
	<li>Space Wolf: The Second Omnibus - William King, Lee Lightner
A great set of stories set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, following Ragnar on a heart-stopping journey as he rises through the ranks of the Space Wolves.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Vitals - Greg Bear
A story about bacteria, the Soviet Union and people attempting to find eternal youth. Not convinced? I thought it was great!</li>
</ul>
<div>There are some more I have read recently, including more from the Warhammer 40,000 universe, zombies and other near future sci-fi. But I'll leave them for later.</div>
