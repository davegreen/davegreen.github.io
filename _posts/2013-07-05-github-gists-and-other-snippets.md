I'm making more of an effort to post useful snippets of PowerShell and other stuff, like custom ADMX templates to either <a href="https://gist.github.com/davegreen">my GitHub Gists</a>, or to a <a href="https://github.com/davegreen/miscellaneous.git">GitHub repository</a> I've set up for miscellaneous bits and bobs.

As I've improved with PowerShell, it's become easier to write generalised scripts, rather than highly targeted ones, so that I can solve similar problems, or share pieces of scripts around more easily.

If you'd like to learn more about Windows PowerShell check out <a href="http://powershell.org/wp/">PowerShell.org</a>Â and the <a href="http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/">PowerScripting Podcast</a>, they are nice friendly places that are easy to navigate and full to the brim with good content.
