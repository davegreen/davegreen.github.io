I'm making more of an effort to post useful snippets of PowerShell and other stuff, like custom ADMX templates to either [my GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/davegreen), or to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davegreen/miscellaneous.git) I've set up for miscellaneous bits and bobs.

As I've improved with PowerShell, it's become easier to write generalised scripts, rather than highly targeted ones, so that I can solve similar problems, or share pieces of scripts around more easily.

If you'd like to learn more about Windows PowerShell check out [PowerShell.org](http://powershell.org/wp)Â and the [PowerScripting Podcast](http://powerscripting.wordpress.com), they are nice friendly places that are easy to navigate and full to the brim with good content.
