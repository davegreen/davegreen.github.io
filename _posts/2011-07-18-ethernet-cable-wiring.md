Just a quick post about something I did a long while ago (but have recently updated).

[Ethernet Cable Wiring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1twfE5i6lyh8TLbdw4ywCzCR6csVA6JnGhQc96gRMep8/edit?hl=en_GB)

It's a guide on making Ethernet cables I created a while ago, parts of it can be used as handouts or part of an information pack for students. It has proven quite useful and attempts to walkÂ people through a 'correct' way to make cables. I sourced information from a couple of websites, including a great article [here](http://www.ertyu.org/steven_nikkel/ethernetcables.html).
