Just a quick post about something I did a long while ago (but have recently updated).

<a title="Ethernet Cable Wiring" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1twfE5i6lyh8TLbdw4ywCzCR6csVA6JnGhQc96gRMep8/edit?hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Ethernet Cable Wiring (Google Docs)</a>

It's a guide on making Ethernet cables I created a while ago, parts of it can be used as handouts or part of an information pack for students. It has proven quite useful and attempts to walkÂ people through a 'correct' way to make cables. I sourced information from a couple of websites, including a great article <a href="http://www.ertyu.org/steven_nikkel/ethernetcables.html">here</a>.
