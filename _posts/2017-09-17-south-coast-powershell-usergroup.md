I gave a presentation at the [UK South Coast PowerShell usergroup](https://twitter.com/UKSthCoastPSUG) back in June about psake and I thought I would post about it (finally!).

It was the first time i'd ever presented to a room of (mostly) strangers, but it was a really rewarding experience and something I am planning to repeat :).

You can find the presentation and the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/powershellorguk/SouthCoast/tree/master/Meetups/2017/June/Build%20automation%20with%20psake)

If you are in the area, I strongly recommend you check it out! The meetup group for the South Coast group is [here](https://www.meetup.com/UK-South-Coast-PowerShell-User-Group/) and the other user groups in the UK and details about them are [here](https://powershell.org.uk/about/).
