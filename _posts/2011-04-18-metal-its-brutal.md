Just a quick update, i'm working on some basslines for the metal tracks me and my mate are working on. I havent got any audio recorded yet (I'm still loving Reaper!) or anything down solid, but it's progressing pretty quickly, so there should be something to show for it pretty soon. There should be 7-8 tracks once we are done, we will probably get a few out there to download for free, to see how people like them.
