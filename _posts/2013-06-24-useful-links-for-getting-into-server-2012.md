If you're just getting into Windows Server 2012, or you're doing a lot of work with it, but want to go a bit deeper into the system, here's a few links that should get you well on the way.

It's also handy if, like me, you've started on the new MCSA/MCSE tracks and want some more resources to read so you can brush up and round out your knowledge.

I'll add links as I remember them, come across them again, or just find new ones. Check back occasionally for updates.

### Note

If you're getting ready to take the 70-410 Exam: Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012, there's a [nice little practice test](http://www.tech-faq.com/70-410-installing-and-configuring-microsoft-windows-server.html) I found that might help you on your way.
