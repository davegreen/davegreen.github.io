Oh my, what a great day! I met loads of great people and in general had a great day with many many ideas to take back to work!

Things started well with the keynote by Richard Siddaway, on his birthday, no less! He gave a great session on where we are, what we're here for and also a bit on where we're going, as well as a great call to action, that consisted of contribute, contribute, contribute!

Right after a quick break, I gave my Test-Business session, which was nervewracking, but ultimately really good (i think?!). I had some great feedback afterward that really made my day. As long as someone is interested to try my code, I'm happy. Slides and content are [on GitHub](https://github.com/davegreen/PSDay2018). 
I'm planning to also do a bit of cleanup and release the module soon as a preview module on the PowerShell Gallery.

The rest of the day was a blur of amazing sessions, speaking to amazing people and a quick jaunt to a pub for a bit more of a geek session! In no particular order, my takeaways were:

- Some excellent tips on Pester mocking from [Mark Wragg](https://twitter.com/markwragg)
- Wonderful quotes from a DevOps culture presentation by [Edward Pearson](https://twitter.com/edwardpearson) (plus loads of book recommendations!).
- Very interesting 'Notes from the field at Jaguar Land Rover' from [James O'Neill](https://twitter.com/jamesoneill)
- Some great chats with a bunch of people including [James Ruskin](https://twitter.com/jpruskin), [Gael Colas](https://twitter.com/gaelcolas) and a quick chat with a guy that came all the way from Australia!

All in all, a magic day, many great people and one of the best days (and the best conference) I've ever been to!
