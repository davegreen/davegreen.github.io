As you can see, the site has changed!

I've made some fairly big changes and I've only restored a couple of the old posts. I'm working on a new project with some cool people at [i3Portal](http://www.i3portal.co.uk) and i'm still playing bass for [Tom Bertram](http://www.tombertram.co.uk).

I also joined [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/neongreenie), I'm not sure how it's going to turn out, but expect a little entertainment.

On a side note, [check out the gigs](http://www.tombertram.co.uk/shows) on the Tom Bertram website! It's really getting going now. I'll try to post some more pictures from those upcoming gigs.
