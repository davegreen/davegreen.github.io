As you can see, the site has changed!

I've made some fairly big changes and I've only restored a couple of the old posts. I'm working on a new project with some cool people at <a href="http://www.i3portal.co.uk/">i3Portal</a> and i'm still playing bass for <a href="http://www.tombertram.co.uk/">Tom Bertram</a>.

I also joined <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/neongreenie">Twitter</a>, I'm not sure how it's going to turn out, but expect a little entertainment.

On a side note, <a href="http://www.tombertram.co.uk/shows/">check out the gigs</a> on the Tom Bertram website! It's really getting going now. I'll try to post some more pictures from those upcoming gigs.
