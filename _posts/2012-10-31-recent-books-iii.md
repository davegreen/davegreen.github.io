Yes, it's been a while, but here are some more great books I have read in the recent past.
<ul>
	<li>Pirate Cinema - Cory Doctorow
A really enjoyable book based in a near future London, where the only difference to reality is the harsh hammer of copyright law. It's a fun adventure and an interesting premise, but I'll have to read it again before I make a decision on whether it's good, or great.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Departure - Neal Asher</li>
	<li>Zero Point - Neal Asher
Enhanced intelligence, emergent AI, guns, space travel and a '1984'-esque government. There's a lot to ponder, plus a good adventure and the overthrow of an oppressive government rolled in. Based on these two books, I can't wait for the third book of 'The Owner Trilogy'.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I, Alex Cross - James Patterson
A modern day murder mystery and a big conspiracy involving the mob, the secret service and some other less than reputable characters. It's a good story, if a bit short, but then theres a bunch of others in the series to read, so they're next.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Covenant - Dean Crawford
Alien remains and the uplift humanity concept explored in this Indiana Jones type adventure for a burnt out war journalist. It's an OK story, but almost all of the concepts have been explored before.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The Restoration Game - Ken MacLeod
It's quite difficult to talk about this one without spoilers. MMO's, a Russia-Georgia conflict and all sorts of weird history and secrets make this one a real rollercoaster. It's probably one of the best books I've read from Ken MacLeod.</li>
</ul>
