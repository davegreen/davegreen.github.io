First things first, my time with the Tom Bertram band has come to an end. It was great fun and I definitely recommend that you check out his album when he releases it.

I'm not doing a lot else at the moment, I have some band auditions coming up, and I'm trying to get a pop-punk or post-hardcore band started up, we'll see how it goes.

I've also changed some of the gear I use, on the amp side I'm using a 500 watt Markbass Little Mark III, as the Ashdown gave up the ghost when it blew the power amp. I can still use it as a pre-amp, for practice and recording, but It's never going to make it to a gig again.

On a happier note, the Little Mark III is an absolute beast of an amp, it sounds just as good, if not better than my Ashdown while being smaller, lighter and running cooler thanks to its class D transformer.

I also have a new bass guitar. It's quite possibly the nicest thing I have ever seen, never mind played! It's a custom ESP Phoenix II, with the custom part being the finish, which is a negative of the black version, so it's a white body, with black pickguard and headstock.

I'll post some pics when I dig out the DSLR, or take some pictures at a practice.
