As you can see, the site has once again changed!

I've made some fairly big changes, but i've kept as much of the old content as I can. There's a few broken links and formatting oddities, but welcome to migrating blog systems!

I'm using Jekyll at the moment, but since I'm a Windows bod, the buildchain is odd. I'm considering Hugo as an alternative, but I'll make sure i've fixed the oddities and the links before I do that.

I'm working on the band side of things again, as well as some exciting projects coming up at work. This means there will hopefully be a few bits of shiny content and perhaps some music!
