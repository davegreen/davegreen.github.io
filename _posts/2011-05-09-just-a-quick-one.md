I've made some more progress with Ruby on Rails and have also got some of my ideas down to flesh out the project I want to create with it. It should be a fairly easy project that I can build up over time and mould into something pretty cool.

In related news: Git is awesome. I prefer it over the alternatives. I never really used it until I started this RoR thing, but now I wouldn't use anything else.
