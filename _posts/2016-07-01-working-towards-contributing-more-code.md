Not long after my first PowerShell gallery submission, which i'm glad will be made redundant after PowerShell 5.1 ships with Get/Set-Timezone cmdlets, it's time for another post on contributing!

I've been working on some build scripts, both privately and [in public](https://github.com/davegreen/PowerShell/blob/master/Modules/Timezone/Build.PSake.ps1) with my Timezone module and I realised it was about time I contributed some of this to other projects that might benefit from the code.

I found that some of my work around script signing could be [contributed directly](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster/commit/d75150d8ef6b65cf1232d981ca2add32d2ec19dc) back to one of the projects I used code from, the [Plaster project](https://github.com/PowerShell/Plaster)! It was good fun doing it and the feedback I got back was great.

Anyways, if you haven't checked out the Plaster project, it's definitely worth checking out and i'll definitely be making time to contribute more to community projects in the future.
