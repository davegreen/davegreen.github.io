If you have problems with your Mac not playing nicely with network resources after sleep, you may find adding the following managed preference useful. It makes the mac prompt for a password after coming out of screensaver/sleep.

Unfortunately, there's no GUI checkbox or anything for this setting in Workgroup Manager, so I've taken a screenshot and highlighted the required setting.
