I read [this post](http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1281257293.html) the other day, it really resonated with me, as I'm starting to feel some of those symptoms (eyes, back, vitamin d). It's a great post and definitely gave me some things to think about, especially with posture.

If you use a computer a lot, check it out. If you play guitar/bass an instrument a lot, check it out. If you sit down a lot... Check it out,Â I think you get the idea.
