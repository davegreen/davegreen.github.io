## Books

### As a Technical Reviewer

Technical review and feedback, making sure the technical content of the book was correct and that examples and code presented were functional and conformed to best practices.

#### [Mastering Active Directory](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-active-directory) by Dishan Francis (Packt Publishing).

A well thought out book covering a large amount of the Active Directory landscape.

#### [Active Directory with PowerShell](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/active-directory-powershell) by Uma Yellapragada (Packt Publishing).

A nice book and would certainly help anyone just getting started with scripting with either Active Directory or PowerShell.

#### [Getting Started with Powershell](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/getting-started-powershell) by Michael Shepard (Packt Publishing).

A well thought out introduction to PowerShell aimed at beginners, split up into easy to digest pieces.
