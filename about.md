If you've made it this far, welcome. My name is Dave Green and I'm an IT Pro with a big interest in computers, flashing LEDs, music, PowerShell, books and a lot of other stuff!

This blog is the place where I post (hopefully) helpful IT stuff, some of which are notes to my future self when I forget! There's also the odd off the wall post on whatever else I fancy writing about.

The best way to find out more about me and the things I do is to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/davegreen), [projects](http://tookitaway.co.uk/projects.html), or [music](http://tookitaway.co.uk/music.html) pages. Alternatively tweet [@NeonGreenie](https://twitter.com/neongreenie), email me at david.green@tookitaway.co.uk or get lots more info about my professional life from my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-green-36312220/).

As is the case with many personal blogs, the views on this site are my own and do not represent the view of anyone else.

This site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://github.com/davegreen/davegreen.github.io), using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll).
