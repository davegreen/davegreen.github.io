If you've made it this far, welcome. My name is Dave Green and I'm an IT Pro with a big interest in music, PowerShell, books and a lot of other stuff!

This blog is the place where I post (hopefully) helpful IT stuff, some of which are notes to my future self when I forget! There's also the odd off the wall post on whatever else I fancy writing about. This site is all my own words and does not represent the views of anyone other than myself.

The best way to find out more about me and the things I do is to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/davegreen), [projects](http://tookitaway.co.uk/projects.html), or my [music](http://tookitaway.co.uk/music.html) page. Alternatively tweet [@NeonGreenie](https://twitter.com/neongreenie), email me at david.green@tookitaway.co.uk or check out the social links on the right hand side.

This site is hosted on GitHub pages, using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll).
